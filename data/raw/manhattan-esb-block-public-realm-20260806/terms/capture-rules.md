### NYC Planimetric Database

Looking for older capture rules? See the [2014 rules](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/tree/planimetrics-2014)

#### Purpose
The purpose of this document is twofold. First, it is intended to define the capture rules for each planimetric feature collected as part of the planimetric update project. As such, this document is meant to clarify questions regarding how the features were captured, provide feature descriptions, and illustrate any exceptions that may apply. Second, since this document provides a wealth of information that would benefit users working with the data, we decided to make it accessible as a secondary source of documentation. This document is not intended to replace the metadata included with the planimetric features but rather to function as an additional source of information. Lastly, the documentation originated from previous planimetric updates. The documentation has evolved and has been refined over each successive planimetric update cycle; and will continue to be extended and maintained over the course of future updates.

#### Introduction
One of the core functions of the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI, formerly DoITT) GIS group is to maintain and distribute an accurate 'basemap' for NYC. Collectively, the basemap includes the digital orthophotography and planimetric features. The basemap provides the foundation upon which virtually all other geospatial data within New York government is registered. Ensuring its completeness and accuracy is fundamental to the Group’s core mission.

As part of a reorganization of New York City government agencies, The Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) was renamed as "Office of Technology & Innovation (OTI)". DoITT and OTI are equivalent terms for the same city agency.

#### Background
Planimetric mapping is the capture of geographic features from aerial survey (i.e., capture of aerial photography) that are traditionally mapped in two dimensions and are therefore exclusive of elevation. Quite simply these are the visible features that can be digitized from aerial photography. Often referred to as planimetric features or simply planimetrics, these geographic features in their sum total essentially represent the base map data (i.e., layers) for a specific area.
NYC  first developed a planimetric database in 2000. The data was captured from the first ‘modern’ aerial survey of the New York City that took place in 1996. Referred to at that time as the NYC Landbase, components of this effort were the establishment of:

* a ‘database design’ (the delivery was ArcInfo coverages)
* coverage parameters (e.g., scale, projection, precision, fuzzy tolerance and dangle length)
* the specific features to be captured
* and a classification scheme (i.e., feature codes)

The delivery of the data was by 2,500′ x 2,500′ tiles, which directly corresponded to the orthophotography tiles.

#### Updates
A subsequent ad-hoc update to the planimetric database was done in 2004. This update was based on aerial surveys from 2001 (Manhattan and Staten Island) and 2002 (Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens). This update conformed to the previous database design. In 2006, DoITT formalized the update frequency of the planimetric database and aerial surveys. The aerial photography would be captured on a two-year cycle and the planimetrics a four-year cycle. The first regularly-scheduled planimetric update was based on the 2006 aerial photography and delieverd in 2008.

With each subsequent update, refinements have been made. New features and domains have been added, obsolete features have been removed, features have been captured in three dimensions, a seamless database has been produced and the time between aerial capture and delivery of the planimetrics has been shortened. For a complete list of the captures, see below.

#### Current Imagery
The source imagery for the current planimetric update was captured on the following dates:

* Manhattan - March 18, 2022
* Bronx - March 16, 2022
* Brooklyn - March 16 and 30, 2022
* Queens - March 16 and 30, 2022
* Staten Island – March 16, 2022

Using this orthoimagery, the planimetric base layers were updated city wide starting in November 2022 and were completed in October 2023

# Imagery and Data Specifications
Digital planimetrics were derived using the imagery products delivered with the 2022 New York Statewide Flyover (see Introduction for specific flight dates), which includes raw imagery collected to support the generation of 0.5 Ft Ground Sample Distance (GSD) natural color imagery. The images were captured with 80% forward lap and side lap to support 1”=100’ mapping and meet the distortion free requirements within New York City. Planimetrics are developed to meet American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Class 1 (one) horizontal mapping standards and ASPRS vertical Class 2 (two) accuracy specifications. 

Planimetrics are delivered via an ESRI geodatabase in New York State Plane Coordinates, Long Island East Zone, NAD83, US foot. The vertical datum for all features is NAVD88.  

For more information on the coordinate reference system used, see the following EPSG definition pages:

Median type hierarchy is as follows: barrier, rail, fence, curb, grass and painted.*

### General Guidelines for Medians

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Sources** | Current imagery - see intro for specific dates.  Previous planimetric database  |
| **Features Captured** | All medians that physically divide a roadbed were collected; which includes medians, traffic islands, "Jersey Barriers", and painted areas that are used to separate traffic flow. |
| **Capture Notes** | Medians are sometimes paved, are normally elevated (have a curb), or have dirt or grass. Medians can have sidewalks crossing them. In those cases, the outline of the largest area was incorporated into a single median feature. The NYC online <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bike-Routes/umu5-zyd3">Bike Routes</a> data was used as a reference to identify potential new medians. Areas where the column ALLCLASSES is equal to I and "I,II" most often contained new medians. New Medians exist throughout the City regardless of these bike lane classifications. Thus, this was considered a supplemental source only. |
| **Features Excluded** | The following features were not captured as medians:<br>• Barriers in front of buildings<br>• Jersey Barriers used to regulate traffic in construction areas, or<br>• Jersey Barriers used to block-off road access. |

| --- | --- |
| **Sources** | Current imagery - see intro for specific dates.  Previous planimetric database  |
| **Features Captured** | Updated all segments between pavement and other surfaces or features (i.e. Curbs, sidewalks, or grass).  |
| **Capture Notes** | Each segment was captured as a continuous feature across a blockface (typically from one intersection to the next – along that side of the road). The vertex between two segments was often located at the street corner. Edge of Pavement features are continuous across driveways, alleys, or access to parking. The one exception to this rule is where a street segment changes names (as determined by <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> Centerline names) outside of any street intersections.  In these cases, the existing CSCL break (node) was used to create corresponding breaks in Pavement Edge segments.For cul-de-sacs, two segments were created. The CSCL centerline was used to define the breakpoints of the Pavement Edge segments.Dead end streets were terminatde where the tax map crosses the road.  Two segments were created on left and right sides of CSCL.On highways, Pavement Edge corresponds to the ‘roadbed’ sub-feature class in [Roadbed](#roadbed), and does not include the shoulder. |

##### 1. BlockfaceID conflation from Pavement Edge to CSCL - Rule for missing CSCL

• If no <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> feature existed on an existing roadbed with Pavement Edge, the production team broke down the Pavement Edge as needed on the approximated center of where a CSCL Centerline theoretically might go.  The team then assigned Left and Right (L/R) BlockfaceIDs to the Pavement Edge.  However, these BlockfaceIDs were not conflated to any CSCL segments (and these Pavement Edge features were flagged as having a BlockfaceID that was not conflated to CSCL).

**The following are examples of where CSCL is missing and PavementEdge exists.**

• When a <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> segment is bounded on one or both sides by a median, the longest edges of median Pavement Edge were assigned BlockfaceIDs, which were conflated onto applicable adjacent CSCL segments.<br>
• Assigned BlockfaceIDs to Pavement Edge for all medians except painted medians.<br>
• Conflated to CSCL where no Pavement Edge derived BlockfaceID takes priority, and there was a CSCL segment that corresponded to the long edge of the median.<br>
• In cases where medians are within medians, the conflating median is the majority (containing) median.<br>
• Pavement Edge features on a median were flagged as having a BlockfaceID that was not conflated to CSCL.<br>

##### 3. BlockfaceID conflation from Pavement Edge to CSCL -  Rule for Multiple CSCL Segments with a Single Pavement Edge

• In cases where there are multiple <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> segments running along a single Pavement Edge (median or otherwise), the BlockfaceID from the Pavement Edge was conflated to the CSCL segments that correspond to the single Pavement Edge.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)



##### 4. BlockfaceID conflation from Pavement Edge to CSCL - Rule for Multiple Pavement Edge with single CSCL segment

• In cases where multiple Pavement Edge segments span a single <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> (median or otherwise), only the BlockfaceID from the Pavement Edge closest to the CSCL segment midpoint was transferred to CSCL.  The other BlockfaceIDs were not conflated to CSCL. An attribute was added to the Pavement Edge database that indicates whether or not each BlockfaceID had been associated with a CSCL segment.

##### 5. BlockfaceID conflation from Pavement Edge to CSCL - Rule for handling complex intersection/median/bridge scenarios

• In cases of complex intersections with multiple medians and/or elevated roadways/bridges, each level was evaluated individually (i.e., at grade, elevated, etc.) in order to logically determine the appropriate break points on medians and to assign BlockfaceIDs to the correct <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a>. The use of Pavement Edge’s polylineZ information and the use of CSCL’s “level codes” were used to determine which features are on the same vertical plane.<br>
• Only the “straight edges” of medians were assigned to CSCL segments.  Small corner segments for triangular medians were not created.

**The screenshot below shows an example of a “complex” intersection.**

**The screenshot below is the same intersection, but showing only the “at grade” centerlines and Pavement Edgs/Median features. Arrows have been included to depict the assignment of L/R BlockfaceIDs for the “at grade” segments in this intersection.**
